        <h1>Ingredients</h1>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Turkey:</strong> This recipe calls for an 18-pound whole turkey.</li>
            <li><strong>Stuffing:</strong> You'll need eight cups of prepared stuffing.</li>
            <li><strong>Butter:</strong> Salted butter, rubbed onto the skin, ensures a juicy roast turkey every time.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt and pepper:</strong> This roast turkey is simply seasoned with just salt and pepper. Of course, you can add more spices to suit your taste.</li>
            <li><strong>Turkey stock:</strong> The bird is cooked in and basted with store-bought or homemade turkey stock.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Steps</h1>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the turkey:</strong> Remove the turkey neck and giblets. Pat the turkey dry with paper towels, then place it (breast-side up) on a rack in a roasting pan.</li>
            <li><strong>Stuff and season the turkey:</strong> Fill the cavity with stuffing. Rub the skin with butter, then season with salt and pepper. Pour two cups of stock into the roasting pan and loosely tent the turkey with foil.</li>
            <li><strong>Roast the turkey:</strong> Roast, basting with stock every 30 minutes, for about two and half hours. Add more stock as the drippings evaporate. Remove the foil and continue roasting until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh reads 165 degrees F.</li>
        </ol>
